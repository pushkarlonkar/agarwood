    description: 'K‑LIFE acquired the estate from its previous owners in early 2013 and subsequently transitioned it from its former identity as Carlton Estate. At the time of acquisition, the land was primarily under tea cultivation with limited mixed cropping. Beginning in 2014, the estate was progressively replanted with Aquilaria saplings, replacing tea as the primary crop. Existing native tree cover was retained to enhance soil health, support biodiversity, and avoid the development of a monocultural plantation.',

    description: 'The plantation continued to mature steadily year on year, with tree spacing deliberately maintained at a minimum of six feet from the base of each tree in all directions — a standard established early and continues to be observed today. This spacing was designed to minimize root competition and prevent root entanglement, ensuring adequate soil volume, nutrient access, and structural stability. These conditions are critical for healthy tree development and for the long-term formation of resin-bearing agarwood.',

    title: 'By 2018, all trees across the estate had reached approximately 15 feet in height, supported by well-developed canopies.',
    description: 'By 2018, the estate had reached an important stage of structural and physiological maturity, with all trees exhibiting sufficient height, canopy development, and overall vigor. While inoculation at this stage is technically feasible and practiced in some plantations, K-LIFE deliberately chose to defer inoculation until the trees reached greater maturity. This decision was driven by a focus on resin quality rather than early yield, as older, more established trees are better positioned to produce higher-grade agarwood resin. Reaching fruiting maturity was therefore treated as a minimum threshold before initiating any inoculation activity.',
